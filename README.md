# Hangman Game – Python (Versions 1, 2 & 3)

This repository contains a Python-based Hangman game that was originally created as a **school-level project** and later **improved incrementally** over time.  
Each version reflects my learning stage and programming maturity at that point.

The project was revisited and enhanced twice:
- once during my **freshman year in college**
- and again recently, with a focus on refinement and better structure

## 🔹 Version Details

### 🔹 Version 1 – School Project
This was the initial implementation of the Hangman game.

**Features:**
- Basic Hangman game logic
- Random word selection
- Simple gameplay flow
- Command-line / basic UI implementation
- Limited validation and error handling

This version focused mainly on **making the game work**.

### 🔹 Version 2 – Freshman year
Version 2 was developed after entering college, with better understanding of programming concepts.

**Improvements over Version 1:**
- Cleaner and more structured code
- Improved game logic handling
- Better user interaction
- Enhanced input validation
- More maintainable and readable structure

Focus on **better code quality**.

### 🔹 Version 3 – Revisited & Improved
Version 3 was created when I revisited the project recently in my 3rd year and just wanted to improve it.

**Improvements over Version 2:**
- Further code refinement and organization
- Additional gameplay or UI enhancements
- Improved user experience
